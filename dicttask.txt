Task:

You need to write an OpenAPI server that serves dictionaries.
The dictionaries itself are now in dsl dictionary (see docs at https://anatoly314.github.io/dsl-manual/), but you are free to convert them to any format you consider fit for task.

The reply should be:
  - fast
  - include all of dictionary data
  - support stresses, conjugations, declensions, cases, syllables, roots, inflections etc
  - support parts of speech etc
  - all of the data that is in the original dicts, should be in answers
  - the answer should be easily machine-readeable for anyone who supports OpenAPI, so simple ubiquitious codecs etc
  - there should be a handle to list available dictionaries and their basic stats


Before finishing:
  - check that the server works and answers
  - check that it can find a word (for example абажур) in dicts
  - the answer should be faster than 0.5s
  - check that the answer is full
