# Building a Local Dictionary API Server

Building a local dictionary API for DSL (Dictionary Specification Language) data involves choices in frameworks, data parsing, storage, and design. The goal is to keep the solution **OpenAPI-compliant**, **simple**, and **high-performance**. Below we explore each key aspect and provide recommendations.

## Python API Frameworks

Choosing a web framework influences development ease and runtime speed. **FastAPI** and **Flask** are two popular options, with a few others worth noting:

- **FastAPI** – A modern asynchronous framework known for its high performance and developer-friendly design. FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI schema and interactive docs (Swagger UI) for your endpoints ([Moving from Flask to FastAPI | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/moving-from-flask-to-fastapi/#:~:text=FastAPI%20supports%20OpenAPI%20along%20with,metadata%20associated%20with%20the%20endpoint)). Under the hood it uses Starlette (ASGI) and Pydantic, making it *“blazing fast compared to Flask”* with performance on par with Node.js or Go APIs ([Moving from Flask to FastAPI | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/moving-from-flask-to-fastapi/#:~:text=OpenAPI%2C%20and%20JSON%20Schema)). It has built-in data validation and type hints, which improve reliability and provide **automatic documentation** for your API ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=,on%20Starlette%2C%20supports%20async%20programming)). FastAPI essentially “stands out for its built-in OpenAPI support, high performance, thriving community, and modern features” ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=match%20at%20L638%20FastAPI%20stands,so%20we)). This means you get **interactive docs and schema** with minimal setup, and fast request handling out-of-the-box.

- **Flask** – A lightweight WSGI framework that is simple to get started with and has a huge ecosystem of extensions. Flask by itself is minimal, but it does **not** generate OpenAPI docs unless you add extensions like Flask-RESTX or Flasgger ([Moving from Flask to FastAPI | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/moving-from-flask-to-fastapi/#:~:text=match%20at%20L664%20Flask%20does,but%20they%20require%20additional%20setup)). It’s synchronous (one request at a time per worker) and slightly slower for high throughput use-cases. Flask is very flexible and easy to learn, but for features like interactive docs or request validation you will need to install additional plugins ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=match%20at%20L638%20FastAPI%20stands,so%20we)). In short, Flask offers simplicity and a small core, but achieving the same level of documentation/validation as FastAPI means introducing more packages.

- **Other Lightweight Frameworks** – Frameworks such as **Falcon** and **Sanic** are designed for speed and low overhead. Falcon is highly optimized and has a *“minimalistic design with few dependencies”* ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=Pros)). In fact, TechEmpower benchmarks rank FastAPI among the fastest Python frameworks, *“outranked only by Falcon and Sanic”* in some tests ([FastAPI vs Flask: Key Differences, Performance & Use Cases](https://bluebirdinternational.com/fastapi-vs-flask/#:~:text=FastAPI%27s%20claim%20to%20fame%20is,only%20by%20Falcon%20and%20Sanic)). However, Falcon lacks built-in OpenAPI support (it relies on third-party libs like `falcon-swagger` which have seen little maintenance) ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=Falcon%20OpenAPI%2FSwagger%20Support)), so you’d have to define the API schema manually. **Sanic** is an async framework like FastAPI; it achieves high throughput and now has an extension that can auto-generate docs (Sanic Extensions uses OpenAPI 3.0) ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=Sanic%20OpenAPI%2FSwagger%20Support)). The trade-off is a smaller community and fewer ready-made add-ons compared to FastAPI or Flask. These ultra-minimal frameworks are excellent for performance, but **require more manual work** to reach OpenAPI compliance and might not be as “batteries-included.”

**Recommendation:** Use **FastAPI** for this project, as it strikes a good balance between ease of implementation and performance. It will automatically produce an OpenAPI-compliant spec and documentation UI for your dictionary endpoints ([Moving from Flask to FastAPI | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/moving-from-flask-to-fastapi/#:~:text=FastAPI%20supports%20OpenAPI%20along%20with,metadata%20associated%20with%20the%20endpoint)), saving you time. FastAPI’s async support also means it can handle concurrent requests efficiently, which is useful if multiple local AI agents might query the server at once. Flask could be used for a very basic API, but by the time you add documentation and parsing libraries, you’d lose its simplicity advantage. Falcon or others are only worth considering if you need to squeeze out every millisecond of performance and are willing to manage the OpenAPI schema yourself. Given that our target is sub-500 ms responses (which FastAPI can easily handle on a single machine), FastAPI is the straightforward choice.

## DSL Dictionary Parsing

**DSL format** (often used by ABBYY Lingvo and GoldenDict) contains rich linguistic data with markup (e.g. for pronunciations, examples, formatting). The goal is to parse these `.dsl` files and preserve *all* the information (phonetic notation, part-of-speech tags, usage examples, etc.) in a format our API can serve.

**Options for parsing DSL:**

- **Use an existing DSL parsing library or tool.** This is the safest approach to retain all data. For example, **PyGlossary** is a widely used tool that can read DSL dictionary files and convert them into other formats. PyGlossary supports `.dsl` as an input and can output to JSON, among many formats ([pyglossary · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyglossary/#:~:text=HTML%20Directory%20,sql%20%E2%9D%8C%20%E2%9C%85)) ([pyglossary · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyglossary/#:~:text=ABBYY%20Lingvo%20DSL%20%20,db%20%E2%9C%85)). Using it, you could convert the entire DSL dictionary to a structured JSON file or even to a SQLite database in a single step. Another option is the `python-dsl` library (also called `dsl2html` on PyPI), which wraps GoldenDict’s parsing code. It *“converts DSL into HTML”* by first building a DOM from the DSL (borrowing the parser from GoldenDict-ng) ([GitHub - Crissium/python-dsl: Python module for converting DSL dictionary texts into HTML](https://github.com/Crissium/python-dsl#:~:text=A%20Python%20package%20to%20convert,HTML%2C%20written%20in%20modern%20C)). This ensures even complex nested tags are interpreted the same way GoldenDict would. Using such a library, you could get each entry’s content in a structured form (HTML or JSON), preserving formatting, phonetics, and links.

- **Convert DSL to JSON manually (one-time conversion).** There are scripts like **DSL2JSON** that demonstrate how to parse DSL with Python. DSL2JSON *“parses and sanitizes DSL tags and replaces them appropriately for readability”* ([GitHub - arianneorpilla/DSL2JSON: A script for converting DSL format dictionaries compatible with GoldenDict to the Migaku Dictionary format.](https://github.com/arianneorpilla/DSL2JSON#:~:text=,term%20and%20definition%20imports%20properly)), outputting a JSON file with terms and definitions. This script handles things like removing or replacing the DSL markup (e.g. `[b]bold[/b]` becomes actual bold markers or plain text) and ensures the JSON contains the term and its full definition text. You can use such a script as a starting point. The idea would be to run the conversion offline: take your `.dsl` file and produce a JSON (or a zipped JSON as that script does for Anki import). Once you have JSON, it’s much easier to load and use in the API server. This approach preserves data *without needing a specialized parser at runtime* – all parsing is done ahead of time.

- **Roll your own parser (not recommended).** Writing a custom parser from scratch for DSL is possible (since it’s a text-based format), but **not advisable** unless no existing tools suffice. DSL format has its own syntax for things like alternative headwords, phonetics (`[c]` color tags for IPA, etc.), and nested formatting. Handling all these edge cases is complex. A custom approach might involve reading the file line by line: identifying headwords vs definitions by indentation or special markers, stripping or converting tags (e.g. `[b]` for bold, `{}` for metadata, `{{...}}` for sound file references, etc.). While you could use regex or Python text processing to do this, there’s a risk of losing information (or introducing bugs). Given that tools like GoldenDict and PyGlossary already handle this format, it’s better to reuse that logic. If you must implement parsing, consider using a parsing library or at least thoroughly test with many dictionary entries to ensure *all linguistic details are preserved*.

**Recommendation:** **Convert the DSL file into a more convenient format (JSON or SQLite) using an existing tool**. For instance, run PyGlossary or DSL2JSON offline to get a JSON dump of the dictionary. This JSON can have an array of entries, each with the headword and an HTML or text version of the definition. By doing this, your API server code doesn’t need to include the DSL parsing logic or depend on heavy libraries at runtime – it will simply load an already-parsed data file. This preserves all content (since the conversion tool is designed for DSL) and simplifies your server. If you prefer not to pre-convert, you could integrate a library like `dsl2html` in your server, but that means compiling the C++ extension which adds complexity. Overall, **pre-processing the DSL into JSON** is the simplest route: you ensure full data fidelity and lighten the load on the API server (which can then just read JSON or query a database).

## Storage Solutions

How you store the dictionary data will affect lookup speed and memory usage. We want something lightweight yet efficient for fast lookups. The typical choices here are either storing data in a **serialized file (JSON)** that’s loaded into memory, or using a **database** like SQLite for on-disk storage with indexes.

- **JSON / In-Memory Dictionary:** Since the dictionary data is mostly read-only (definitions don’t change often), one approach is to keep it in a JSON or Python dictionary structure. For example, you could have a JSON file where each entry is an object like `{"term": "apple", "definition": "..."}`. At server startup, load this file and create a Python dict mapping terms to definitions. This gives extremely fast lookups: dictionary hash lookups in Python are average O(1) time (constant time) regardless of the number of entries ([python - Efficient Dictionary Searching? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19103785/efficient-dictionary-searching#:~:text=,search%20for%20a%20given%20key)). Even if you have tens of thousands of words, a hash table lookup is essentially instantaneous (microseconds). As one source notes, *“if your data fits in memory and you only require access by key, a dictionary is probably just enough for your needs.”* ([python - json or sqlite3 for a dictionary - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9484814/json-or-sqlite3-for-a-dictionary/9484859#:~:text=If%20your%20data%20fits%20in,just%20enough%20for%20your%20needs)) In other words, for a static word->definition mapping, an in-memory dict is ideal. The downside is memory usage – but even a large dictionary (say 100k entries) might be on the order of a few tens of MB of text, which is fine for modern systems. Using JSON + dict keeps things simple (no separate database process) and fast. You just need to be mindful to load the data once at startup to avoid reading from disk on each request.

- **SQLite Database:** SQLite is a serverless, file-based database that comes with Python (`sqlite3` module) and is very suitable for local apps. It can easily handle dictionary sizes and allows you to perform SQL queries for lookups. A simple design is to have a table with columns like `(term TEXT PRIMARY KEY, definition TEXT, ...)` and create an index on the term. Looking up a word then translates to a SQL query `SELECT definition FROM entries WHERE term=?`, which SQLite will execute quickly by using the index (roughly O(log N) time, but highly optimized C code). This might be marginally slower than an in-memory dict, but still easily within tens of milliseconds or better for a single lookup. SQLite also has the advantage of allowing more complex queries if needed (e.g., partial matches or searching within definitions). It’s a good choice if your dataset is too large to fit comfortably in memory, or if you want to avoid loading everything at once. Since SQLite reads from disk, the first access might hit the disk cache, but frequently accessed pages will stay in memory. For a single-user local server, SQLite can handle hundreds of queries per second with ease. Another benefit is that SQLite can be a **single source of truth** – you could update the database if needed without regenerating a whole JSON. However, for a read-mostly use case, both JSON and SQLite are fine. If you do go with SQLite, you can either bundle the `.db` file (created by a one-time import of the DSL data) or generate it at startup by reading the DSL/JSON. Keep in mind that writing to SQLite from multiple threads needs a bit of care (it locks the database per write), but reads can happen in parallel. Given our scenario is mostly reads, SQLite would be very low overhead.

- **Other storage (NoSQL, etc.):** For completeness, you could also consider simpler key-value stores or even just flat text files. A Python **shelf** (the `shelve` module) could persist a dict on disk, but it’s not as efficient as SQLite for large data. NoSQL stores (like TinyDB or integrating something like Redis) would be overkill here – they introduce additional moving parts without clear benefit. Since we want minimal dependencies, sticking to either a JSON file or the built-in SQLite is preferable to using an external database service. It’s worth noting that *“dictionaries are better for simple and small datasets, and databases are good for complex and large data sets.”* ([dictionary - What are the relative advantages of dictionaries versus databases? - Software Engineering Stack Exchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/129043/what-are-the-relative-advantages-of-dictionaries-versus-databases#:~:text=It%27s%20impossible%20to%20give%20a,complex%20and%20large%20data%20sets)) Our case is relatively simple (key-value lookups), so a full-fledged external database isn’t necessary unless the dataset is huge.

**Recommendation:** Use a **JSON or SQLite-based approach** rather than a heavy database. If the entire dictionary can be loaded into memory (which is likely), the simplest implementation is: parse the DSL to a JSON structure, then `json.load()` it into a dict in your FastAPI app. This gives lightning-fast lookups and zero latency from I/O on each request. If memory is a concern or you want to support partial text search, go with **SQLite**. You can load the DSL into SQLite (maybe using a script or PyGlossary’s SQL output) and create appropriate indexes. Then use Python’s `sqlite3` module in the API to query it. SQLite is included in Python and doesn’t add dependencies, and it can even be used in-memory (`:memory:` database) if you still prefer loading everything but using SQL for querying. For straightforward term -> definition queries, an in-memory dict is probably the fastest option. In summary, **both JSON-in-memory and SQLite will meet sub-500 ms performance easily** – choose based on your familiarity and whether you need SQL features. Given minimal dependencies, leaning on the Python standard library (json or sqlite3) is ideal.

## Efficient Multi-Word Lookup Strategies

“Multi-word lookup” can mean two things: looking up entries that themselves consist of multiple words (e.g. phrases or idioms), and performing searches using multiple words (like a full-text search for words appearing anywhere). We want to handle both efficiently without overly complex solutions.

- **Exact phrase matching (multi-word terms):** Many dictionary entries are multi-word phrases (e.g. “credit card”, “high school”, idioms like “kick the bucket”). To ensure these are found quickly, treat the phrase exactly as you would a single word. If using a dict or database, the key would be the full phrase string. For example, in a Python dict, you’d have an entry for `"credit card"` -> its definition. A query for “credit card” will hash to the correct key in O(1) time just like a single word. There is no added complexity here – just be sure your data import doesn’t split the phrase. In the DSL, multi-word headwords are usually on one line, so they’ll naturally become one key. Thus, the **indexing technique** is simply to index the entire term string. As long as your lookup uses the full phrase as the key, it’s as fast as any other lookup. No special trick is needed to handle spaces in keys in Python or SQL (SQLite index can index a text field with spaces without issue).

- **Multiple separate words (full-text search):** If the use-case involves searching for entries that contain *all* words in a query (not necessarily as a contiguous phrase), then an inverted index or full-text search mechanism is helpful. A simple approach is to build an **inverted index**: map each word to the list of entry IDs or terms that contain that word. This is how search engines work – a one-word query is trivial by looking up the word’s list ([algorithm - Use of indexes for multi-word queries in full-text search (e.g. web search) - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6032469/use-of-indexes-for-multi-word-queries-in-full-text-search-e-g-web-search#:~:text=inverted%20indexes,index%20is%20structured%20like%20this)) ([algorithm - Use of indexes for multi-word queries in full-text search (e.g. web search) - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6032469/use-of-indexes-for-multi-word-queries-in-full-text-search-e-g-web-search#:~:text=But%20what%20about%20queries%20which,implementation%20would%20be%20the%20following)), and a multi-word query involves taking the intersection of the lists for each word ([algorithm - Use of indexes for multi-word queries in full-text search (e.g. web search) - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6032469/use-of-indexes-for-multi-word-queries-in-full-text-search-e-g-web-search#:~:text=1,intersection%20of%20A%20and%20B)). For example, if a user searches “bank account”, you retrieve the list of entries with “bank” and those with “account” and then find the intersection to get entries that have both. In a dictionary scenario, this could help if someone queries a phrase that isn’t an exact headword – e.g., searching “red fruit” might want to find entries where both “red” and “fruit” appear (maybe “apple” entry contains “fruit that is red”). To implement this without heavy dependencies, you could pre-compute a mapping of every word to the set of entries containing it. Then on a query with multiple words, compute the intersection of the sets. This is straightforward in Python (sets intersection is efficient) but does add memory overhead. 

- **Using SQLite FTS:** If you opt for SQLite, an excellent feature to leverage is **Full-Text Search (FTS)**, which is built for multi-word queries. SQLite’s FTS5 module creates a special index on text content that allows fast searches for words, prefixes, phrases, etc. It *“provides fast and flexible full-text searches of your database content”* ([SQLite Full-Text Search: Your Ultimate Guide to Optimizing Queries - SQL Knowledge Center](https://www.sql-easy.com/learn/sqlite-full-text-search/#:~:text=Firstly%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20crucial%20to%20understand,like%20a%20web%20search%20engine)) by tokenizing the text into words. With FTS, a query for “red fruit” can be done with a single SQL query (`SELECT * FROM entries_fts WHERE definition MATCH 'red AND fruit';` for example) and SQLite will use its full-text index to quickly find matches. This avoids you writing your own inverted index logic, at the cost of slightly more complex setup (you need to create a virtual FTS table and load the data into it). However, since FTS5 is part of SQLite (no extra install needed in Python aside from enabling it), it’s still a lightweight solution. If your dictionary API might need to handle arbitrary word-in-definition searches or fuzzy matching, FTS is the way to go. If not, and you only need exact headword lookup, you can skip it.

- **Avoiding over-engineering:** If the main scenario is that an LLM agent will ask for a definition of a term or phrase, you likely don’t need a complex multi-word search across definitions. It might be sufficient to do: if the query string (after maybe trimming) contains spaces, first try to find an exact match for the whole string as a term. If not found and if it seems like multiple terms, you could split the query and look each part up individually, returning multiple results. For example, a query “cat dog” could return the definition of “cat” and “dog” separately if the combined phrase isn’t an entry. This is a simple fallback that covers cases where a user might input multiple words intending multiple lookups. It’s important to clarify the expected behavior: do we need to support multi-word *queries* as in search, or just multi-word *entries*? In either case, **keeping an index on the full term string** covers phrase entries, and using a basic inverted index or SQLite FTS covers multi-word search queries.

**Recommendation:** **Index by the full headword/phrase** for direct lookups, and consider full-text search if needed for broader queries. In practice, this means if you have a JSON or DB, ensure that phrases like “credit card” are stored as one key and can be retrieved directly. For additional flexibility (perhaps the LLM might ask “find ‘credit’ in definitions”), using SQLite FTS is a neat solution that doesn’t require an external search engine. It gives you advanced search with minimal fuss – e.g., one can query definitions containing multiple terms in well under 100 ms even for large datasets, thanks to indexing. If you don’t foresee needing that, a simpler method is: for a query with multiple words, split it and do multiple lookups (or intersections) in memory. This avoids any heavy algorithmic complexity and given a dictionary size, it will be fast enough. In short, **keep multi-word lookup simple** – exact matches for phrases via normal keys, and use SQLite FTS or a Python set-intersection if you need to support searching within entries for multiple words. Both approaches avoid bringing in big search engine dependencies and keep response times low.

## Error Handling Best Practices

Robust error handling is important for an API that will be consumed by applications or agents (in this case, local LLM agents). We want to return informative errors in a structured way, so the client (or agent) can understand what went wrong. Key best practices include using proper HTTP status codes and clear messages, while not leaking internal details.

- **Use HTTP status codes appropriately:** For any request that fails, return a status code that reflects the type of error. Common cases:
  - **400 Bad Request** – if the client’s request is malformed or missing required parameters. For example, if your API expects a query parameter or path like `/define/{word}` and none is provided or it’s empty, you’d return 400 with a message like “Query parameter ‘word’ is required.”
  - **404 Not Found** – if the requested word or endpoint isn’t found. In our dictionary scenario, a query for a term that doesn’t exist in the dictionary should return 404. The response body can say something like `{"detail": "Term not found"}`. Using FastAPI, this is simple: you can `raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")` when a word isn’t in the data ([Handling Errors - FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#:~:text=%40app.get%28,items%5Bitem_id)). This will automatically produce a JSON error response with that message.
  - **422 Unprocessable Entity** – this is specific to frameworks like FastAPI which use it for validation errors (e.g., if a query parameter is the wrong type or fails validation). FastAPI will return a 422 with a detailed error JSON if the input doesn’t match the expected schema (for instance, if an integer was expected but a string was provided) ([Handling HTTP errors with FastAPI — Safir](https://safir.lsst.io/user-guide/fastapi-errors.html#:~:text=FastAPI%20automatically%20generates%20HTTP%20errors,parameter)). You get this for free by declaring your request models or parameters with types.
  - **500 Internal Server Error** – for uncaught exceptions or server-side issues. Ideally, your code should catch foreseeable errors and convert them to 400s or 404s, so a 500 means something unexpected went wrong. You generally shouldn’t disclose internals in a 500 error; a generic message “Internal error” is fine, but also log the details on the server side for debugging.

- **Return errors in a JSON structure:** Since this API is meant for programmatic use (by LLM agents or other software), send error details in a machine-readable format (JSON), not HTML error pages. FastAPI and Flask both allow returning JSON responses easily. FastAPI by default will return errors as JSON with a `detail` field (and possibly `errors` list for validation issues) ([Handling HTTP errors with FastAPI — Safir](https://safir.lsst.io/user-guide/fastapi-errors.html#:~:text=FastAPI%20automatically%20generates%20HTTP%20errors,parameter)). For example, a 404 returns `{"detail": "Not Found"}` by default, or your custom message if you provide one. Maintaining a consistent error response format helps clients parse it. You could define a structure like `{"error": "<type>", "message": "..."}` if you want more fields, but sticking to the default FastAPI style (`{"detail": "..."}`) is fine. The key is consistency.

- **Provide helpful messages without exposing too much:** The error messages should explain the problem. If a term isn’t found, saying “Term not found” is more helpful than a generic “Error” message. If input is invalid, FastAPI’s validation errors will, for example, specify which field is wrong. Avoid including sensitive information (stack traces, file paths) in the error sent to the client. For instance, if a database query fails, catch that exception and return a 500 with a generic message rather than letting an SQL error bubble up. The client (LLM) likely doesn’t need to know internal implementation details, just that their request failed and why in general terms.

- **Gracefully handle malformed inputs:** Users (or an AI agent) might send input that doesn’t make sense – e.g., a very long string, or invalid characters, or even a number when a word is expected. Your API should not crash in these cases. Employ validation (with Pydantic models or manual checks) to detect issues and respond with a 400-series error. For example, you might check that the query term consists of letters/spaces and isn’t too long, else return a 400 with “Invalid term format”. By doing input validation, you avoid unnecessary processing and you give immediate feedback. FastAPI’s dependency injection and Pydantic can handle a lot of this automatically (e.g., if you declare a query parameter `word: str = Query(..., min_length=1)` it will ensure it’s at least one character, otherwise a 422 error with a clear message is returned without you writing any code).

- **Use exceptions in the framework to simplify error responses:** In FastAPI, the idiomatic way is to `raise HTTPException(status_code, detail=...)` as mentioned. This stops the request handler and sends the error. For Flask, you can use `abort(404, description="...")` or return a Flask `Response` with an error status and JSON. It’s good practice to register a global error handler to catch any error you didn’t anticipate – for example, using Flask’s `@app.errorhandler(Exception)` or FastAPI’s exception handlers – but for a simple API, you might not need a complex setup. Just ensure each endpoint catches what it can (like KeyError for missing word) and returns the right HTTPException.

**Recommendation:** **Implement clear and consistent error responses using HTTP codes and JSON messages.** For example, in FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException

@app.get("/define/{term}")
def define_term(term: str):
    if term not in definitions:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Term not found")  #  ([Handling Errors - FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#:~:text=%40app.get%28,items%5Bitem_id))
    return {"term": term, "definition": definitions[term]}
```

This will automatically give a 404 response with `{"detail": "Term not found"}` if the term is missing. Similarly, you might raise a 400 if some required parameter is missing or invalid (though, if you use path params and required query params, the framework ensures they’re present or returns a validation error for you). Take advantage of **FastAPI’s automatic validation and error handling** – it will, for instance, return a 422 with a detailed error list if the input JSON to a POST endpoint doesn’t match the Pydantic model, etc. ([Handling HTTP errors with FastAPI — Safir](https://safir.lsst.io/user-guide/fastapi-errors.html#:~:text=FastAPI%20automatically%20generates%20HTTP%20errors,parameter)). Make sure to test some error scenarios (ask for a non-existent word, omit a required field in a request) and see that the API returns a useful message. This will make the API robust when integrated with an LLM agent, as the agent can check for a non-200 status and then decide how to proceed (maybe inform the user the word wasn’t found, etc.). Finally, document the possible error responses in your OpenAPI spec (FastAPI can include these in the docs with `responses={...}` in the decorator, or using Pydantic’s validation schema). This ensures the API consumers know what to expect.

## Performance Considerations

To meet the requirement of sub-500 ms response times on a single instance, we need to design for efficiency. Fortunately, a dictionary lookup is not heavy work, and with the right choices the response times should be in the order of a few milliseconds to tens of milliseconds. Here are performance-related tips:

- **Avoid on-the-fly parsing or processing for each request.** Do any heavy lifting once at startup (or offline). For example, **do not parse the DSL file on every request** – that would be extremely slow. Instead, load your data into memory or initialize your database when the server starts. That way each API call only does a quick lookup in an already-prepared data structure. This amortization is crucial. Reading from an in-memory dict or a database index is very fast, whereas reading and parsing a large file could take hundreds of milliseconds (or more) each time. By preparing data in advance, each request’s work is minimal (just a hash table lookup or SQL SELECT).

- **Choose a high-performance server setup:** If using FastAPI, use Uvicorn (an ASGI server) in production. Uvicorn with FastAPI is highly optimized and asynchronous, which helps in handling concurrent requests efficiently. FastAPI’s design (using Starlette) means it has very little overhead per request. Benchmarks show FastAPI can rival lower-level languages’ frameworks in speed ([Moving from Flask to FastAPI | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/moving-from-flask-to-fastapi/#:~:text=OpenAPI%2C%20and%20JSON%20Schema)). In fact, for simple JSON serialization endpoints, FastAPI often outperforms Flask significantly ([FastAPI vs Flask: Key Differences, Performance & Use Cases](https://bluebirdinternational.com/fastapi-vs-flask/#:~:text=FastAPI%27s%20claim%20to%20fame%20is,only%20by%20Falcon%20and%20Sanic)). So, implementing with FastAPI already gives a good foundation. Ensure you run Uvicorn with `--workers` if you want to handle multiple requests on multiple CPU cores, but even a single worker can handle many requests sequentially if each is fast. If you use Flask, consider running it with Gunicorn or Waitress in production and enabling multiple threads or processes. The bottom line: the framework should not be the bottleneck – FastAPI in particular is designed for speed and *“ranks as one of the fastest Python web frameworks”* ([FastAPI vs Flask: Key Differences, Performance & Use Cases](https://bluebirdinternational.com/fastapi-vs-flask/#:~:text=FastAPI%27s%20claim%20to%20fame%20is,only%20by%20Falcon%20and%20Sanic)).

- **Efficient data lookup:** As discussed in storage, a Python dict lookup or a parameterized SQLite query on an indexed column is extremely fast. Accessing a value from a dict is O(1) and does not grow with dataset size ([python - Efficient Dictionary Searching? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19103785/efficient-dictionary-searching#:~:text=,search%20for%20a%20given%20key)). So even for a large dictionary, the lookup time for the definition is constant (and negligible). SQLite with an index will use a B-tree lookup, which is also very fast (logarithmic, but for, say, 100k entries, log₂(100k) ~ 17, so perhaps 17 steps – trivial in C). In practice, either method will likely return results in a few milliseconds at most. The 500 ms budget is very generous – a well-optimized local API should respond in under 50 ms easily for a single word query (not counting any network overhead, which is minimal on localhost). To ensure this, avoid anything that could slow down each request: e.g., don’t open and close a database connection for every request (keep a global connection or use a connection pool), don’t load large files each time, and don’t execute any heavy algorithms.

- **JSON serialization overhead:** One thing to consider is the time to serialize the response to JSON (since our API will likely return JSON). For a simple dictionary entry (a word and its definition), even if the definition is a few paragraphs of text, the serialization is quite fast in Python (the limiting factor might be that Python is not as fast as C for string concatenation, but `uvicorn` and `fastapi` handle it well). Still, if you are returning a very large definition or multiple entries, that conversion to JSON and writing to the socket could take some milliseconds. It should be well under 500 ms unless the data is huge. If performance becomes an issue, you could consider using **ujson** or **orjson** libraries which are faster at JSON encoding than the standard library. However, in a simple API like this, the standard `json` library is probably fine. Just be mindful if you ever plan to send bulk data (like returning a list of 100 definitions at once) – then the bottleneck might be how fast you can dump all that text to JSON. But for one word’s definition, it’s negligible.

- **Concurrent request handling:** If multiple local LLM agents or processes might query the API simultaneously, ensure your server can handle a few concurrent connections. FastAPI with its async nature will handle concurrent I/O-bound tasks without spawning new threads (for CPU-bound tasks like heavy computation, you’d need to be careful, but our workload is I/O-bound and light CPU). If using a dict, there’s no real I/O delay, so the async part isn’t giving much benefit except allowing the server to scale to multiple simultaneous clients. In any case, consider running the API with more than one worker (process) if you expect a high volume of requests at the same exact time, to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. For example, `uvicorn main:app --workers 2` will run two processes. Each process can likely handle dozens of queries per second easily. This is probably over-optimizing, since local use by an LLM agent suggests maybe one request at a time as the LLM thinks, but it’s good to note.

- **Profiling and monitoring:** As you implement, it doesn’t hurt to do some timing tests. You can use `time.time()` or `perf_counter()` around your lookup code to ensure it’s fast (in development). If you find any call taking a significant fraction of a second, investigate. Perhaps loading the definition from disk? (Solution: preload it). Perhaps some regex replacement on the definition text? (Maybe do it once at import time rather than per request). Since our target is quite achievable, the main risk is accidentally doing something inefficient per query. Also, avoid unnecessary copying of large strings – for example, if definitions are large, returning them directly from your data structure is better than constructing new modified copies on each request. That said, if you had to, say, inject some HTML tags or format the output on the fly, that’s still string processing which Python can handle quickly for a single item.

**Recommendation:** Keep each request’s work minimal and use FastAPI’s strengths to your advantage. With the data in memory (or a fast DB lookup), your API should be **able to answer in a few milliseconds**. FastAPI’s own overhead is low – by design it’s *“high-performance… thanks to its use of asynchronous programming”* ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=,on%20Starlette%2C%20supports%20async%20programming)). To stay well below 500 ms, ensure no blocking calls that could delay responses. If you use SQLite, you might want to enable WAL mode and connection pooling so that reads don’t block each other, but in a single-process scenario it’s likely fine. Since this is a local server, network latency is negligible (loopback interface). One area to watch is startup time: loading a large DSL or JSON could take a second or two, but that’s acceptable as it’s a one-time cost. After that, each query is fast. In summary, **prepare everything upfront, then each request just does a quick lookup and returns JSON.** With that pattern, meeting the performance goal is straightforward.

## Minimal Dependencies

To keep the project maintainable and lightweight, it’s best to minimize external dependencies and complexity. This means favoring built-in modules and well-established libraries over introducing new or heavy components.

- **Use standard library features when possible:** Python’s standard library offers a lot of what we need: `json` for reading/writing JSON data, `sqlite3` for a lightweight database, and built-in data structures for caching. By using these, you avoid adding third-party packages. For example, instead of using an external JSON database or ORM, a simple SQLite table or an in-memory dict suffices. This keeps installation simple (just Python itself). Similarly, for concurrency, you don’t need a task queue or anything; the web framework and server can handle our modest needs.

- **Choose a framework that provides needed features out-of-the-box:** This reduces the need for extra libraries. FastAPI is a good choice because it already includes automatic docs (OpenAPI), request validation, and JSON serialization support. If we chose Flask, we would likely add Flask-RESTX or a similar library to document the API, plus perhaps Marshmallow or Pydantic for validation – each of those is another dependency. FastAPI’s philosophy of leveraging Pydantic and Starlette internally means you get those features without adding them yourself. So while FastAPI itself is an external dependency, it **consolidates multiple capabilities in one**. As noted, Flask’s flexibility comes at the cost of needing extensions for things like OpenAPI support ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=match%20at%20L638%20FastAPI%20stands,so%20we)). By using FastAPI, we *avoid* needing to pull in those separate extensions.

- **Avoid large frameworks or servers not tailored to this use case:** For example, using **Django or Django REST Framework (DRF)** for this would be overkill. DRF is powerful but heavy, introducing a lot of modules, an ORM, etc., which we don’t need for a simple dictionary lookup. It would be more complex to set up and slower due to its abstraction layers ([Top 20 Python API Frameworks with OpenAPI Support | Zuplo Blog](https://zuplo.com/blog/2024/11/04/top-20-python-api-frameworks-with-openapi#:~:text=Cons)). Similarly, you don’t need an enterprise server like Apache or Nginx in front for a local tool – a simple Uvicorn or Flask built-in server (for dev) is fine. Every additional moving part (like a caching layer, a message queue, etc.) should be questioned: do we truly need it for a local dictionary? Likely not. Keep the architecture as simple as: **Python process running the API** and the data either in memory or in a local file. This one-process design reduces points of failure and dependency hell.

- **Limit dependencies to well-maintained libraries:** If you do use any library (say, to parse DSL or for an inverted index), choose ones that are popular and stable. For DSL parsing, PyGlossary is actively maintained and used in many projects, so it’s a safe dependency. If you prefer not to include it in the deployed app, run it offline to generate data. That way the server doesn’t even depend on PyGlossary at runtime (only at build time). This approach of offloading complexity to a build step can drastically reduce the runtime dependencies. Your API server might then only need FastAPI and maybe Pydantic (which comes with FastAPI) – both being very common. Always try to reuse what’s already available in the environment (like SQLite) rather than requiring the user to install and configure something new.

- **No external services:** Ensure the solution works without requiring external internet access or cloud services. A local LLM agent should be able to use this API without network. So the dictionary data and search should be self-contained. That means not relying on an external API for definitions (which would defeat the purpose) and not using something like ElasticSearch (which is far too heavy and a separate service to run). The idea is a small footprint tool. Everything should run on the user’s machine with minimal setup (installing one Python package perhaps, and having the dictionary file).

**Recommendation:** **Keep the dependency list short and essential.** FastAPI (or Flask) for the API, plus possibly one library for DSL parsing or data storage if needed – that’s it. In practice, that might mean a `requirements.txt` with just `fastapi` and `uvicorn` (and maybe `pydantic` pinned, though FastAPI will bring it in). If you use SQLite via the stdlib, that’s zero extra packages. If using PyGlossary in-app, that’s one more, but as mentioned you could avoid that by converting data beforehand. Avoid anything that adds a lot of weight (e.g., a huge ML library or heavy database driver). By having fewer dependencies, you reduce the risk of conflicts and the maintenance burden of updates. It also makes the deployment simpler (for instance, you can zip up the app and it’s small). This minimalist approach aligns with the requirement to not introduce excessive complexity. In summary, design the system such that **the only components are your Python script, the framework, and the data file** – nothing more. This will yield a clean, maintainable local dictionary API.

## Conclusion and Implementation Summary

Bringing it all together, here’s a recommended approach for a **local DSL dictionary API server**:

- **Framework:** Use **FastAPI** for the API layer. It will handle routing and automatically generate an OpenAPI spec and docs for you ([Moving from Flask to FastAPI | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/moving-from-flask-to-fastapi/#:~:text=FastAPI%20supports%20OpenAPI%20along%20with,metadata%20associated%20with%20the%20endpoint)). FastAPI’s high performance ensures each request is handled quickly ([Moving from Flask to FastAPI | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/moving-from-flask-to-fastapi/#:~:text=OpenAPI%2C%20and%20JSON%20Schema)), and its simplicity will keep implementation time low. Define endpoints like `GET /define/{word}` to fetch a definition. Leverage Pydantic models for any request/response schemas if needed (though for just returning a definition a simple dict might do).

- **DSL Data Parsing:** Pre-process the `.dsl` dictionary file **offline or at startup**. Ideally, convert it to JSON using a tool like PyGlossary or a script. This conversion will parse all the linguistic data (preserving formatting, phonetics, examples). The output could be a JSON file with an array of entries or a key-value mapping of terms to definitions ([GitHub - arianneorpilla/DSL2JSON: A script for converting DSL format dictionaries compatible with GoldenDict to the Migaku Dictionary format.](https://github.com/arianneorpilla/DSL2JSON#:~:text=,term%20and%20definition%20imports%20properly)). By doing this ahead of time, the API doesn’t need to include the parsing logic. If offline conversion is not feasible, integrate a parsing library (e.g., use `pyglossary` programmatically or the `dsl` C++ parser library) to load the DSL file on startup into a Python structure. In either case, after startup you should have the dictionary data ready to query in Python.

- **Data Storage and Lookup:** Store the parsed data in a way that allows **fast lookups**. The simplest is an in-memory Python **dict**: e.g., `definitions = {"apple": "<definition>", "credit card": "<definition>", ...}`. This allows O(1) lookups for any term ([python - Efficient Dictionary Searching? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19103785/efficient-dictionary-searching#:~:text=,search%20for%20a%20given%20key)). If memory is a concern or you want partial search, use **SQLite**: create a table for entries and use an index on the term. You can even load this SQLite database into memory for faster access (`sqlite3.connect(':memory:')` and copy data into it) if needed, but on SSD, disk access with cache is fine. Ensure multi-word terms are stored exactly as keys (including spaces/punctuation as in the DSL). Consider adding a full-text index if you need search-by-words capability, using SQLite FTS for efficiency ([SQLite Full-Text Search: Your Ultimate Guide to Optimizing Queries - SQL Knowledge Center](https://www.sql-easy.com/learn/sqlite-full-text-search/#:~:text=Firstly%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20crucial%20to%20understand,like%20a%20web%20search%20engine)).

- **API Endpoints and Multi-word Logic:** Implement an endpoint (e.g., `/define`) that accepts a word or phrase. When a request comes in, **sanitize the input** (trim whitespace, maybe lowercase it if your keys are normalized that way). Then perform the lookup:
  - If the term exists as a key in the dictionary, return the definition.
  - If not, and if you want to support multi-word search, you could split the query into words and search each. For example, if `"red apple"` isn’t a key, split into `["red", "apple"]`. Find definitions for each or find entries that contain both words (if using an inverted index/FTS). Then return those results or an error if nothing found. 
  - If the term is not found at all, return a 404 error with a clear message ** ([Handling Errors - FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#:~:text=%40app.get%28,items%5Bitem_id))**.
  - Optionally, have another endpoint like `/search` for doing substring or full-text search if you implemented that (so `/define` remains exact-match and `/search` could be more flexible).
  
  Document these behaviors in the OpenAPI schema (FastAPI will list them, you can add description and examples).

- **Error handling:** Use exceptions to manage errors. For instance, if input is missing or too long, raise `HTTPException(400, "Bad request: ...")`. For not found, as mentioned, raise 404. FastAPI will handle translating these into JSON error responses. The errors will have a structure with a detail message ([Handling Errors - FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#:~:text=if%20item_id%20not%20in%20items%3A,items%5Bitem_id)) which the LLM agent can read. Ensure that for any unexpected server error, a 500 is returned – FastAPI does this by default if an unhandled exception occurs. You might add a catch-all exception handler to log such cases. Test the API with some invalid inputs to see that it fails gracefully and quickly (e.g., ask for a word not in the dictionary).

- **Performance tweaks:** Since the heavy work is done upfront, each request is just a dictionary lookup and returning JSON. This should easily be <10 ms per request on average hardware, which is well below 500 ms. Still, deploy with Uvicorn using a sensible number of workers if needed. The app being local means latency is minimal, but you could still use HTTP keep-alive to avoid re-establishing connections (most frameworks do this by default). Essentially, out-of-the-box FastAPI on Uvicorn will meet the performance needs. There’s no need for additional caching layers – an in-memory dict *is* a cache in effect. Just avoid doing anything per-request that could introduce delay (no heavy computations or blocking I/O).

- **Keep dependencies minimal:** In your `requirements.txt`, you might just have `fastapi` and `uvicorn[standard]`. If you use a DSL parsing library at runtime, include it (e.g., `pyglossary` or `dsl2html`). But if you parse offline, the server code won’t need those. You’ll likely also have `pydantic` (installed via FastAPI) and any other small library you consciously choose. Don’t include large frameworks or database servers – they aren’t needed here. Rely on the standard library for JSON and SQLite (no need for an ORM or external DB). By keeping it lean, you make the installation and maintenance easier, and reduce the potential for dependency conflicts.

This approach ensures an **OpenAPI-compliant API** (thanks to FastAPI) that is easy to implement and **highly efficient** in serving dictionary lookups. The local LLM agents can query this API for definitions or related information, and they will get quick responses (<500 ms easily) with all the rich data from the DSL preserved. The overall design is simple: a single Python service, no extra services, and clear logic. By carefully choosing tools (FastAPI, pre-parsed data, SQLite/memory store), we satisfy all the requirements: correctness of data, speed, and simplicity.
